# Role and Task Generator @[raavuer.github.io](https://raavuer.github.io)

Role and Task Generator was made to streamline / simplify the process of pulling names from a hat when role playing in real life games.

Note: The page hosted on github will not have css styling applied because the css is located in the public folder where the express app can access it.
